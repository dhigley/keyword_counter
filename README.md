# keyword_counter
A keyword counter implemented in Java

Write a program to read the text from a text file. The text file is passed as a command-argument. Words are delimited by whitespace, characters, punctuation marks, quotation marks, and parentheses. Count words in case-insensitive fashion (e.g., consider "Good" and "good" to be the same word). The words must start with a letter.  Display the output in alphabetical order of words, with each word preceded by its occurrence count.
